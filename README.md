# Mabasej_Team
We are working on system, that will help tourists in cities to get information about city more easily.

# Hardware
- Raspberry PI (for now tested only on rpi4. Works on rpi zero too, but it will be slow if more devices are connected)
- External/Internal WiFi antena

# Software
- python 3.9.2 compatible server with basic web interface
- Kotlin based mobile app

# Install
Wikispot is in testing stages, but it is possible to install it using our .img file (link coming soon) based on DietPi or custom script.
